# empMgm
This is a beta version of a GUI based employee's time and payroll management software.
It is currently under testing at a retail location. Lots of other features will be added 
in near future. Any suggestion to imporve this software is appreciated.

In final version, empManagement_v4 is going to be the executable file and the temporary 
password is 4309 to get into the actual GUI where all the interfaces are going to be 
available. Or, for testing purpose, you can bypass authentication by executing guiPage_v4
directly.
